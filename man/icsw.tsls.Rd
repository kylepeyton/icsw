\title{
Two-stage least squares with inverse complier score weighting
}
\description{
Estimate average treatment effects using two-stage least squares
with a binary instrument and binary treatment and weighting with
inverse complier scores (probabilties of compliance). Optionally,
bootstrap the entire estimation process for the purpose of hypothesis
testing and constructing confidence intervals.
}
\usage{
icsw.tsls(D, X, Y, Z, W, weights = NULL,
  R = 0, estimand = c("ATE", "ATT"),
  min.prob.quantile = NULL,
  min.prob = NULL, ...)

icsw.tsls.fit(D, X, Y, Z, W, weights,
  estimand = c("ATE", "ATT"),
  min.prob.quantile = NULL,
  min.prob = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{D}{
Binary treatment of interest.
}
  \item{X}{
Matrix of covariates for two-stage least squares. Add a constant if desired (see examples). 
}
  \item{Y}{
Outcome.
}
  \item{Z}{
Binary instrument.
}
  \item{W}{
Matrix of covariates for compliance model.
}
  \item{weights}{
Observation weights.
}
  \item{R}{
Number of bootstrap replicates.
}
  \item{estimand}{
Whether to estimate average treatment effect (default) or
average treatment effect on the treated.
}
  \item{min.prob.quantile}{
Compliance scores are truncated to this quantile of positive compliance scores.
}
  \item{min.prob}{
Compliance scores are truncated to this value.
}
  \item{\dots}{
Additional arguments to \code{compliance.score}.
}
}

\value{
If R = 0 or icsw.tsls.fit is called directly, a model fit,
as described in \code{\link{lm.wfit}}.

If R > 0, a list with elements
\item{fitted.model}{
  A model fit, as returned by \code{\link{lm.wfit}}.
}
\item{coefs.boot}{
  p by R matrix of model coefficients for each of R bootstrap replicates.
}
\item{coefs.se.boot}{
  Vector of standard deviations of coefficients under bootstrap resampling
  (i.e., bootstrap standard errors).
}
